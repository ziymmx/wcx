/**
 * A [Backdrop] that samples an arbitrary native Android [View] — not the Compose tree.
 *
 * The miuix-blur backdrop effects (blur / lens / vibrancy) apply a `RenderEffect` to a
 * [GraphicsLayer] whose contents must be recorded *from within Compose*. The built-in
 * `LayerBackdrop` therefore only ever contains Compose-drawn pixels, which is useless when the
 * glass floats as an overlay on top of WeChat's own native views: there is nothing Compose-drawn
 * behind it, so the layer is empty and the glass shows nothing.
 *
 * This backdrop instead records `sourceView` (WeChat's ViewPager) into the layer whenever the
 * source content redraws, so the real chat / contacts / discover content shows through the glass.
 * It cannot capture hardware surfaces (SurfaceView / TextureView — e.g. video calls or Channels),
 * which draw blank behind the bar; that is an accepted limitation of View.draw().

    // to re-run its layer recording; a plain View.invalidate() only recomposites the cached render
    // nodes and would NOT re-run the capture, so a settled static tab froze on its last frame.

    // content genuinely needs to redraw. When WeChat is idle nothing dirties the source, we skip the
