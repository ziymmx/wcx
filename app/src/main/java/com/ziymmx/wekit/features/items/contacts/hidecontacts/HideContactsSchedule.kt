/**
 * The 定时显示/隐藏 scheduler.
 *
 * ## Why AlarmManager and not a coroutine
 *
 * `com.ziymmx.wekit.agent.trigger.TriggerScheduler` sleeps in-process on purpose (its triggers are
 * only meaningful while WeChat runs). This one must fire at a wall-clock time the user picked, which
 * means surviving Doze — hence `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle`. The coordination model is still
 * TriggerScheduler's: [resync] is the single reconciliation point, called on install and — via
 * [mutate], the sole external mutation entry point — after every list mutation, cancelling everything
 * before re-registering from the current list.
 *
 * ## What this cannot do, and why the startup catch-up exists
 *
 * The module cannot add a `<receiver>` to WeChat's manifest, so [AlarmReceiver] is registered at
 * runtime and therefore only exists while this process does. When an alarm fires with the main
 * process dead the broadcast lands nowhere and is simply consumed — no process is started. That is
 * precisely what [catchUp] compensates for: on every `onEnable` we look backwards for the most recent
 * fire time that has already passed and apply *that* entry's action, so the state the user asked for
 * is what they get on the next launch regardless of what the process was doing at the time.
 *
 * ## Relationship to the manual toggle
 *
 * A schedule only ever *writes* `temporarilyShown` at its fire instant. It does not lock it: `#show`,
 * `#hide` and the triple-tap gesture stay live and their result survives until the next fire time or
 * the next manual change. The catch-up runs once per process, at attach time.
 *
 * ## Accepted limitation: time-zone and clock changes
 *
 * No `ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED` / `ACTION_TIME_CHANGED` receiver is registered. Alarms are armed as
 * absolute `RTC_WAKEUP` instants computed from the local zone at arm time, so a TZ change or a DST
 * transition between arming and firing makes exactly *one* fire land at the wrong local time (off by
 * the offset delta). It self-corrects immediately: [onFired] recomputes the next occurrence from the
 * clock as it is *then*, and [resync] recomputes everything on the next install. One mistimed
 * 显示/隐藏 flip after a flight or a DST switch was judged not worth a broadcast receiver whose only
 * job is to call [resync].

     *
     * Why this exists instead of a plain `schedules = ...` write: the natural Compose pattern is
     * "read the list on dialog open, write the whole edited list back on commit". [onFired] does a
     * read-modify-write of its own (delete a fired `ONCE` entry) under this object's monitor, but the

     * [catchUp] would re-apply its action. Routing every write through this `@Synchronized` method
     * closes that window, since it shares the monitor with [onFired] and [catchUp].
     *
     * Note this overwrites the *entire* stored list with the sanitized result of [transform], unlike
     * [removeStored] which preserves malformed entries it isn't targeting — a UI commit reflects
     * everything the user saw and edited, so it's correct for it to drop what [schedules] already
     * filtered out rather than resurrect it.
     *
     * [transform] must be pure, fast and non-blocking: it runs while this object's monitor is held, so
