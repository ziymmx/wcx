 * Query-time hiding.
 *
 * Almost everything WeChat displays comes out of SQLite, and almost every read funnels through one
 * wrapper — `ka5.b0.g(String sql, String[] args, int) -> Cursor` (`ka5/b0.java:1009`; `b0.B(sql,
 * args)` is just `g(sql, args, 0)`). Every `com.tencent.mm.storage.*` storage class goes through it,
 * so hiding a contact from a new surface is usually a matter of recognising one more query shape
 * rather than finding a new hook. That is what [WRAPPER_RULES] is for.
 *
 * Two paths bypass the wrapper and are handled separately:
 * - FTS (global search) issues its reads via `com.tencent.wcdb.database.SQLiteDatabase
 *   .rawQueryWithFactory` — see [installFtsHook].
 * - The Moments feed goes through `WeDatabaseListenerApi`, which calls [rewriteMomentsFeedSql].
 *
 * Bind arguments are always passed separately from the SQL text, so injecting literal
 * `NOT IN ('...')` predicates is safe everywhere here.
