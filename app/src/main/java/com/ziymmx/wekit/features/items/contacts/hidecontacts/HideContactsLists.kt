/**
 * List/adapter-level hiding for the surfaces whose rows never pass through a rewritable SQL query.
 *
 * The SQL rewriter in HideContactsSql.kt covers everything WeChat reads out of `rcontact` /
 * `rconversation` with a statement we can see. The four surfaces installed here are invisible to it:
 *
 * - the 通讯录 and @成员 lists are MVVM "live lists" whose rows are already-materialised
 *   `Contact` objects by the time any adapter sees them;
 * - group-member lists come from `chatroom.memberlist`, a `;`-separated string column, so there is
 *   no per-member row to filter in SQL at all;
 * - 收藏 has largely moved to the WCDB ORM builder (`r82.e` / `br5.f`), which emits no raw SQL;
 * - 视频号 like lists are network-driven protobuf, with no local table behind them.
 *
 * Every hook here filters the *input* the adapter is built from rather than remapping adapter
 * indices. That is deliberate: an earlier iteration of this feature shifted `getView` positions
 * through a `hiddenPositions` set without touching `getItem`, so tapping a row opened the wrong
 * chat. Cutting the entry before the adapter ever counts it keeps `getCount()`, `getItem()` and
 * every click listener consistent by construction, and a resolve failure degrades to "the contact
 * stays visible" instead of "the wrong contact opens".
 *
 * Filtering is done by **substituting a filtered copy**, never by mutating the collection WeChat
 * handed us, unless that collection is provably a per-call/per-response object with no other
 * consumer. 隐藏 here is a display-time decision that `#show`, the triple-tap gesture and the
 * 定时显示 scheduler must be able to undo instantly; a destructive `removeAll` on a list the host
 * retains would make "temporarily show" unable to bring the rows back until WeChat repopulates it.

/**
 * `MvvmList.e(List snapshotList)` is WeChat's per-list "preprocess the snapshot before it reaches
 * the adapter" hook, and both list classes implement it identically: sort the snapshot in place,
 * walk it once to recompute the section headers *from whatever it was handed*, then `map` it into a
 * list of *clones* which becomes the adapter's data. Everything downstream — the adapter rows, the
 * section flags and (for `AtSomeoneLiveList`) the A-Z index list it rebuilds into its `C` field — is
 * derived from the argument alone, so replacing the argument with a filtered copy in a `hookBefore`
 * yields a fully self-consistent result with no index arithmetic anywhere. Verified identical on
 * 8.0.69, 8.0.74 and 8.0.76 (`ui/contact/address/AddressLiveList.e`,
 * `ui/chatting/atsomeone/AtSomeoneLiveList.e`).
 *
 * The argument is **substituted, not mutated**. `MvvmList.l()` calls `e(this.f182257p)`
 * (`plugin/mvvmlist/MvvmList.java:373` on 8.0.76, `:373` on 8.0.74, `:361` on 8.0.69), i.e. `args[0]`
 * *is* the list's persistent snapshot field, not a per-call copy. An earlier version of this hook
 * called `removeAll` on it, which deleted the rows out of WeChat's own backing store: `#show`, the
 * triple-tap gesture and a scheduled SHOW could not bring the 通讯录 rows back, and neither could
 * un-hiding a contact, until WeChat repopulated the list from its data source.
 *
 * A `hookAfter` on the return value would not do either: it would drop the adapter rows but leave
 * the section headers that `e()` already computed over the unfiltered snapshot, so a section whose
 * only member was hidden would keep its header. Filtering the input is what keeps them in sync.
 *
 * `AddressLiveList` (通讯录) and `AtSomeoneLiveList` (@成员) differ only in their entry class
 * (`ah5.g` vs `com.tencent.mm.ui.chatting.atsomeone.b` on 8.0.76), and both entry classes carry the
 * contact as their single `com.tencent.mm.storage.*` field, so one reflective shape works for both —
 * hence the shared [hookMvvmListPreprocess] helper, which is the only thing either surface installs.

 * `e01.e2.b(username, "@micromsg.qq.com", …)` emits, and it is what keeps 群聊 (`@chatroom`) and
 * 企业微信 (`@openim`) out of the total.
 *
 * Accepted limitation: `username not like '%@%'` is hardcoded here, but `e2.b` forks on the
 * `usernameFlag` experiment (`com.tencent.mm.contact.d.f93632g.a()`, `e01/e2.java:434` on 8.0.76) and
 * emits `and ( usernameFlag in ( 0 ) )` instead when it is on. The two are semantically the same
 * classification — `usernameFlag` is the denormalised form of "is this a plain wxid" — so the mirror
 * stays correct in practice. If that column ever lags behind `username` for some row, WeChat's total
 * and this mirror would disagree about that row and the footer could be over-subtracted by one. Not
 * worth a second query path: the failure mode is a slightly wrong count, never a wrong row.
 *
 * [excluded] mirrors the two vararg groups WeChat turns into `and rcontact.username != '<each>'`
 * terms. Skipping them would over-subtract: `ContactCountView` passes `e01.e2.f269714p` plus
 * `z1.r(), "weixin", "helper_entry", "filehelper"`, and entries like `filehelper` or `medianote`
 * satisfy `type & 1` and contain no `@`, so they are pickable as hidden contacts yet were never in
 * WeChat's total to begin with.
 *
 * The `or username = 'weixin'` disjunct is reproduced too, parenthesised: it re-admits 微信团队
 * unconditionally, whatever its flags, so a hidden `weixin` really is in WeChat's total.
 *
 * The statement runs on WeKit's own database handle rather than WeChat's storage wrapper, so it
 * cannot re-enter the wrapper hook. Its formatting deliberately differs from WeChat's
 * (`type & 1 != 0` vs `type & 1 !=0`, and the hidden-set predicate comes first) so it can never be

 * member counts, @全体 delivery and message routing) untouched.
 *
