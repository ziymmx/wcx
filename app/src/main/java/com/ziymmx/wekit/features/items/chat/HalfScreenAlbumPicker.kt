     *
     *  - **Top padding.** MMActivity picks its EdgeToEdgeWrapperLayout branch independently of
     *    `fixStatusbar`, and that wrapper pads from window insets. A bottom-anchored sheet does
     *    not intersect the status bar so those insets should already be zero, but WeChat
     *    re-applies padding on later inset dispatches.
     *  - **FLAG_FULLSCREEN.** ImagePreviewUI's `fullScreenNoTitleBar(true)` does not set the flag
     *    inline — it posts a runnable that calls `setFlags(FLAG_FULLSCREEN)` 256 ms later, so
     *    clearing it during onCreate does nothing. Left set, the status bar hides across the whole
     *    screen and the chat above the sheet loses it too. (No-op for AlbumPreviewUI, which never
     *    sets the flag.)
     *  - **Status bar.** ImagePreviewUI paints its status bar dark (it is a full-screen photo
     *    viewer by default), but the sheet does not extend under the system bar, so that dark
     *    color would sit above the exposed chat. Reset the system bar to transparent so the chat's
     *    own status bar area shows through, and make the bar icons follow night mode so they stay
     *    visible against it. WeChat re-applies its color late (256 ms after onCreate), hence the
     *    per-layout correction.
     *
     * Each check is guarded on the current value, so it settles after one extra layout pass
     * rather than looping.
