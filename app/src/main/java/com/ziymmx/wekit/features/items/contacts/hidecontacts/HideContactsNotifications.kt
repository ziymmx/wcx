/**
 * Notification suppression for 隐藏联系人, split out of [HideContacts] so it can also load in
 * `com.tencent.mm:push`.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate feature
 *
 * WeChat raises new-message notifications from `com.tencent.mm.booter.CoreService`, which the host
 * manifest pins to `android:process=":push"`. [HideContacts] does not override
 * `shouldLoadInCurrentProcess`, so it only ever loads in the main process — which means the
 * `dealNotify` hook it used to install inline was registered in a process that never calls it. The
 * suppression therefore (almost) never fired. There is a second path on top of that: the LightPush
 * builder raises the notification and plays the ringtone/vibration straight off the push payload and
 * never goes through `dealNotify` at all, so it was not covered even in principle.
 *
 * Widening [HideContacts]'s process set is not an option: its `onEnable` is almost entirely
 * main-process work (SQL hooks, LauncherUI/ChattingUI hooks, the screen-off receiver, the shake
 * detector, the one-shot legacy `parentRef` DB migration) that would be wrong — and in the migration's
 * case racy — if it ran a second time in `:push`. So only the two notification hooks live here, in a
 * feature modelled on
 * [com.ziymmx.wekit.features.items.notifications.NotificationsEvolved], which already opts into
 * main + push the same way.
 *
 * ## Not user-visible on purpose
 *
 * This is an [ApiFeature] in the `API` category, so it never shows up in the feature list or in the
 * settings search (which only lists `SwitchFeature`s). Notification suppression is not a separate
 * user-facing concept — it is part of "隐藏联系人" — and a second toggle for the same concept would
 * only be confusing. Instead the hooks are installed unconditionally and read [HideContacts]'s own
 * persisted on/off state per invocation, so flipping the 隐藏联系人 switch takes effect immediately
 * without a restart, in both processes.
 *
 * ## Known inconsistency: `temporarilyShown` is main-process only
 *
 * [HideContacts]'s temporary-show escape hatch (`#show` in the input bar, or the triple-tap on the
 * main-screen title) is a plain in-memory flag in the main process; it is deliberately **not**
 * persisted. `:push` cannot see it, and duplicating it into MMKV would mean persisting a state that
 * is supposed to die with the process. The accepted consequence: while temporary-show is active a
 * hidden contact's chats and contact rows reappear, but their **notifications stay suppressed**.
 * Turn 隐藏联系人 off entirely to get notifications back.

     * (8.0.76 `:497`, 8.0.69 `:483`), binding `str`→userName positionally, and `str` is reused as the
     * talker further down (`"... talker: %s, tipsFlag: %s "`).
     *
     * The anchor occurs exactly once per tree, and in both cases the target method is the last
     * declaration before it, so the string is inside the method DexKit will return — which is what
     * makes this matcher safe, not `allowFailure`. `allowFailure` covers **only the 0-hit case**:
     * `DexMethodDelegate.find` (`dexkit/dsl/DexDelegates.kt`) `error()`s on a multi-hit regardless of
     * it. It is set here purely for the 0-hit case: only 8.0.76 and 8.0.69 could be inspected, and on
     * an unverified 8.0.6x build a 0-hit would mark this feature broken and pop the dex-repair dialog
     * on every launch — worse than losing the LightPush bypass while [methodDealNotify] keeps working.
